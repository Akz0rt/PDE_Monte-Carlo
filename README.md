# Monte-Carlo method to solve partial differential equations
### The files on this repository contain a method for solving boundary value problems for the one-dimensional heat equation, as well as the two-dimensional Laplace equation with given boundary conditions.
##### The file SolveHeat.py corresponds to the code for solving the heat equation in a rod of small thickness with a given length of the rod and information about the behavior of the thermal field at its ends.
##### The file solve_laplace.py accordingly refers to the Laplace equation in a rectangle on some two-dimensional plane.
